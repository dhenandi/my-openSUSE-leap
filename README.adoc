Hello,

I've just installed openSUSE Leap on My Old Notebook because i just bought an SSD :D.

This is my notebook spec:

. ASUS x450JB (Bought on 2015)

. 12 GB RAM
. SSD 240 GB (Samsung 860 EVO)
. SATA HDD 1 TB
. NVIDIA GeForce 940m

I want to share how i configuring and customizing after i installing the openSUSE on my ASUS. Below is the items :

. Change to local mirror repo (repo.opensuse.id)
. Add Packman Repo
. Update and Upgrade Systems
. Codec Installation
. VLC Installation
. MP4/H.264 Support on Firefox
. Flash Player Installation
. Installed GNOME Extensions
. Customizing theme using Arc theme
. Customizing theme using Numix Icon

. Preferences Configuration
. Swipe 3 Finger

. Vagrant Installation
. Visual Studio Code Installation
. Terminal Modification using ZSH

*Note*: I use BTRFS Partition. Benefits if you use BTRFS system you can do system restore/snapshot on your openSUSE.

== Preamble

First, after bought SSD, i have download the ISO on https://repo.opensuse.id and burn to USB disk using BalenaEtcher.

When installation running, i use BTRFS Systems and disable the snapshot. I will use snapshot manually.

And i use GNOME for my Desktop Environtment. 

After update.

. Firefox Update to 60
. 

Preferences:
. Natural Scrolling
.
